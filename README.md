## üìå Support Center Portal is my first project working with Angular & Java Spring Boot.

**Support Center Portal** is a web application project I made with a trainee in a internship at PEAQOCK Financials. The web application is a support portal that manages tickets created on products by users. Tickets created and viewed by technicians who can assign the ticket and stay in touch with the user. The application also has an administrative part that allows you to manage the users of the application.\
The technologies used as mentioned previously are Angular and Java Spring Boot.\
Angular is built using TypeScript which is a superset of JavaScript. It offers classes, modules, and interfaces to help you build robust components.\
Spring Boot Framework is widely used to develop REST APIs. It aims to simplify Java EE development that makes developers more productive. It aims to shorten the code length and provide the easiest way to develop Web Applications.
